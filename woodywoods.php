<div class="boardoverview">
<p>This board has ten star spaces, the most out of any Mario Party board. Unlike Space Land, there's no in-board indicator to show where the star spaces are. You can pause the game to see where they are. Once again, there's only four star spaces that can be the first star:</p>

<p>The gimmick of this board comes down to these arrows. Whichever way the arrow is facing, you have to take it. At the start of the game, they all face right.</p>

<p>Not only that, but there are ways to switch the signs earlier. For one, you'll see that right before each junction is an Event Space. Landing on it will cause the sign ahead (and only that one) to switch directions.</p>

  <source src="videos/woodywoods/ItemShopFirstHalf.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Because of that, items will come in handy. The first item shop is only seven spaces away from the start. Not only is this the closest a shop has been from the start, but that means you might be able to get an item on your first turn. For the first half of the game, your options, much like Space Land, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skeleton Key for 3 coins</li>
<li>Cursed Dice Block for 3 coins</li>
<li>Double Dice for 5 coins</li>
<li>Warp Block for 7 coins</li>
<li>Triple Dice for 10 coins</li>
<li>and Custom Dice Block for 12 coins</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p>The Cursed Dice Block, Double Dice, Triple Dice, and Custom Dice Block are all great at dealing with the sign gimmick. If you want to reach the sign while it's facing the direction you want, you can use a Double Dice or Triple Dice to make it. Most of the time, the Triple Dice is better, but keep in mind that it is possible to roll too high. You'll see that the signs after the first one aren't too far away, and it might be the case that you end up going to the next sign while it's facing the wrong way. For that reason, there are times when the Double Dice is better. The Cursed Dice Block has two usages, since you can use it on yourself or set it off on another player. If a player is approaching an arrow that is facing the right way, you can use the Cursed Dice Block on them to miss out on the path they want. You can also use it on yourself when the upcoming arrow is facing wrong, so you'll stall yourself to wait for it to switch the next turn. When it comes to doing this, you have to keep in mind the Event Space right before the junction, since landing on it will switch back to the direction you don't want to go the next turn. That's one reason why the Custom Dice Block is overall the best item to deal with the arrows. You can either use it to guarantee you roll high enough to go past the arrow while it's right, or land on the space right before the Event Space to wait for it to change the next turn. However, the item does cost 12 coins, which is the most expensive of the 4 options. Indeed, if you reach the item shop on your first turn, you won't be able to afford that, as you'll only have 10 coins.</p>
<p>When it comes to the first star, you might have to settle on a 3 coin item or no item at all to afford it. Two of the stars are right after the first sign, so you can get them on your second turn. One of them is on the left side of the sign, and the other is on the right side. At the start of the game, the signs face to the right, so it will be pointing to the left for the second turn. However, if an odd number of players land on the first Event Space (by rolling a 10), the sign will still be pointing to the right the next turn.</p>
</div>
<div class="imagefloat">
<img src="images/woodywoods/Skeleton Gate 1 Woody Woods.png" alt="Skeleton Gate 1" class="floatimage">
<p>At the start, you also have the option of looping around the beginning section. Thanks to having several blue spaces, 3 item spaces, and a Lucky Space, you can stock up on items and rack up some coins by staying over there. It also has the first Skeleton Gate, which you can use if you get a Skeleton Key from an Item Space or a Lucky Space. It's a way to get out of there, but it narrowly misses a star. Instead, it acts as a shortcut to another star. However, to get it, the sign on the far right must be facing right. From there, you'll return to the start, with another star space on the route. But the main draw is the Chance Time Space. If you have a Cursed Dice Block or a Custom Dice Block, you can use it to land on this Chance Time space if you need to turn things around.</p>

<p>Back to the signs, let's say you go left. A few spaces in is Woody, which you can activate by landing on one of three spaces in front of him. You then have two fruits to choose from. One gives you between 4 and 15 coins, and the other lets you roll another dice block, giving you great mobility in one turn. Looking at the board, you can see this event is near two star spaces. If one of them is active, you can choose the coins if you are short a few coins, or choose the Dice Fruit to potentially reach the star that turn.</p>

</video>
<p>In the original board from Mario Party 3, choosing nothing resulted in you getting the Dice Fruit every time. However, in this game, you'll get nothing if you don't choose in time. Thankfully, it doesn't have to be random what you get. You can pick one as they are falling, so rather than just picking a direction first, wait to see which one you want, and then go for it. You should have enough time to do that.</p>

<video width="540" height="360" class="floatvideo" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="videos/items/Cursed Dice Block Guarantee Woody.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<p>Because there are three spaces to trigger this event in a row, I will mention that if you land on the blue space before them, you can guarantee this event by using a Cursed Dice Block on yourself.</p>

<p>After Woody is a junction that either goes to another sign or is a loop around to the first sign. The latter also has access to another item shop. This is the Forest Shop, and it has a completely different set of items. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mushroom for 3 coins</li>
<li>Chomp Call for 6 coins</li>
<li>Plunder Chest for 20 coins</li>
</ul>
<p>That's right. For the first time, you can now get a Plunder Chest from an item shop! 20 coins is a rather high price, though, so it should be saved for items that are worth it, like a Boo Bell or Double Star Card.</p>
</div>
<div class="imagefloat">
<img src="images/woodywoods/Skeleton Gate 2 Woody Woods.png" alt="Skeleton Gate 2" width="500" class="floatimage">
<p>If you instead go up, again, you'll come to the next sign, which determines whether you'll go left or right. This sign doesn't have to be as decisive as the others, due to the board's second Skeleton Gate. If you bring along a Skeleton Key, you can guarantee to be on the way to the left path. Either the arrow will be facing the right way, or it won't, but you can go through the gate. Best of all, there isn't a star space that you'll be missing out on by not going left. Instead, you'll be missing out on the next event, which might be a good thing.</p>

<div class="onevideo">
<video width="540" height="360" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="videos/woodywoods/Warukio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Like Woody, there's three Event Spaces in a row, but this time, it's for Warukio, which is essentially the opposite of Woody. Again, you choose between two fruits. One takes away between 4 and 15 coins, and the other one lets you roll a dice, but this time, you go back the number you roll.</p>

<p>This time, not choosing a fruit will have you receive both fruit. I can't think of a scenario where both losing coins and going back is the better move. It's better to just choose one.</p>

  <source src="videos/woodywoods/Warukio Roll Far Enough Back to Go Behind Sign.mp4" class="floatvideo" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>It's possible to go back so far that you go behind the sign, which is a possible way of undoing going that path if you meant to go right. There are some issues with this. Not only do you have to roll high, but you might land on the Event Space which might put you back on the left path (if the arrow is facing left.) There's also the risk of ending up on a Bowser Space. But it is worth noting that, should you choose the Reverse-Dice Fruit, you have a pretty good chance of landing on a Lucky Space or Item Space, so you can use that to maybe get an item like a Mushroom or Double Dice to roll high enough to skip past these Event Spacest.</p>
</div>
<div class="imagefloat">
<img src="images/woodywoods/vsboo.png" alt="VS Space before Boo" class="floatimage">
<p>No matter if you go left or right, you have to go past a Koopa Bank, but the top path has an extra perk: it has Boo. Boo happens to be just a few spaces after the Koopa Bank, so you'll need a few more coins to steal a star than normal, and that's another reason against choosing the Minus Coin Fruit from Warukio. But if you are short in coins, consider the VS space right before Boo. The Koopa Bank is a double-edged sword, too, as if you land on it, you'll receive more coins to steal a star as well!</p>

  <source src="videos/woodywoods/ItemShopSecondHalf.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>All paths eventually meet up, where you can then visit another item shop. Speaking of, when it comes to the latter half of the game, the Cursed Dice Block no longer is an option. It is instead replaced with the Golden Pipe for 25 coins. And here's where the board completely changes. As you can imagine, going for stars normally is a struggle, thanks to the board's frustating gimmick. By that point, you might have accumulated enough coins that you can pay up the steep price for the Golden Pipe. And so, for the rest of the game, the main item you (and likely everyone) will want to go for is the Golden Pipe.</p>
</div>

<video width="540" height="360" class="floatvideo" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="videos/woodywoods/ForestShopSecondHalf.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>The Forest Shop also has a new inventory, but the three old options are still available. Instead, the new option is a Hidden-Block Card for 40 coins. It's rarely a good idea to buy the Hidden-Block Card here. Sure, you can get a star, but there's always the chance of just getting a few coins, and if the latter happens, you sure aren't going to get your money back. Even if you do get the star, you're only saving 5 coins compared to getting a Golden Pipe and using it to get a star, except the star is guaranteed with the Golden Pipe. The other three options are still better, but the Plunder Chest has a great use now. It can deter people from getting a Golden Pipe.</p>

<p>Basically, if you have a Plunder Chest, players shouldn't be getting Golden Pipes, since you can just take it from them. If they do have a Golden Pipe, they immediately have to use it so you can't steal it from them, even if they won't be able to buy the star due to lack of coins. However, if the player has at least one other item, you aren't guaranteed to get their Golden Pipe, so if you have an item like a Skeleton Key, that acts as a sort of protection from players trying to steal a Golden Pipe from you.</p>
</div>

  <source src="videos/items/Plunder Chest 5050 Lose.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Another counterplay is to get a Plunder Chest yourself. As long as you have at least one other item, if the player tries to steal your Plunder Chest, they might not get it, meaning they'll no longer have a Plunder Chest while you still do. But as you can see, even then, it is possible they'll just take the Plunder Chest you just bought from you.</p>

</video>
<p>All that being said, the rest of the game doesn't have to resort to Golden Pipes and Plunder Chests. Also consider the Warp Block (or Super Warp Block should you get one) to try to swap places with a player on their way to Boo or about to buy a Golden Pipe. If you get a Chomp Call, consider using it when the star is at a desirable location. There's quite a few of them. Two put the player on the way to Boo (although one requires a Skeleton Key to get to Boo), and others are near an item shop to either get a Plunder Chest or Golden Pipe. Still, if you have enough coins, it is better to opt for Golden Pipes more often than not.</p>
<img src="images/woodywoods/goodstarspaces.png" alt="Stars Near Item Shops or Boo" width="800">
<p>And that's it for Woody Woods. It's an item-centric board where you need items like a Custom Dice Block and Cursed Dice Block to help deal with the signs. But with how interfering they are, once the Golden Pipe becomes available at shops, that becomes your main priority.</p>
