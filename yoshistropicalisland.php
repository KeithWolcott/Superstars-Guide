<p>This board consists of two islands: Watermelon Island (the left one that everyone starts on) and Cantaloupe Island (the right island.) At the beginning of the game, the one star on the board is located on Cantaloupe Island. Meanwhile, Bowser is chilling on Watermelon Island.</p>

<p>However, the star and Bowser will switch spaces any time one of the 7 Event Spaces are landed on. Because of that, you can't always bet on the star staying on the island you are on.</p>
<p>If you reach the star, you can purchase it for 20 coins. If you reach Bowser instead, some things can happen.</p></div>

<p>One option is that Bowser will give you a Cursed Dice Block for a random price between 11 and 20 coins. The other is based on the original, where he gives you a Bowser Tube, also for a random price, that pops after it inflates, wasting your money. If you don't have enough coins, he'll just take them all.</p>

<p>However, if you visit him in last place, there's a very small chance that he'll give you 5 coins. Don't bet on it, though. Usually, the previous options will occur.</p>

  <source src="videos/yoshistropicalisland/Thwomp.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>You utilize the Thwomps to go from one island to another. You have to pay him to go across. There's two Thwomps - one at the bottom to go from Watermelon Island to Cantaloupe Island, and one at the top to go from Watermelon Island to Cantaloupe Island. The first player to reach a Thwomp can pay as little as 1 coin. The catch is that the next player has to pay at least 1 more coin to go across. If they don't have enough coins, they can't pass. What this means is that, should a player set a large cost to a Thwomp, they can essentially block off that Thwomp if players aren't able to cough up its price. In the original, the cap was 50 coins, but it can be well over 100 in this game. Just watch out for Lucky Spaces, as one of the events divides the price of both Thwomps in half.</p>

<p>As the star starts out at Cantaloupe Island, you may opt to go to that island at the start of the game. You'll get a star, assuming you can afford it, as long as an even number of Event Spaces are landed on (and that includes 0.) One of the features Cantaloupe Island has is Boo, which comes up 6 spaces after either Toadette or Bowser. It's incredibly unlikely you'll be able to steal a star if you go to Cantaloupe Island first, but you can at least steal coins from players about to reach the star to make it so they can't afford the star. Besides that, Boo can also be used to limit player's usage of Thwomps. You can make it so that players will either have to spend almost all (or all) of their coins to go to another island, or better yet, make it so they can't afford the Thwomp. As for stealing a star, it should be noted that the Thwomp to go to Watermelon Island is just seven spaces after Boo, so keep in mind if you will be able to afford to utilize the Whomp after paying 50 coins to steal a star.</p>

<p>There is a reason to stay on Watermelon Island, though, and that is because it has the board's only item shop. It shows up 6 spaces after the first Thwomp. Your options are:
<ul>
<li>Mushroom for 3 coins</li>
<li>Cursed Dice Block for 3 coins</li>
<li>Double Dice for 5 coins</li>
<li>Warp Block for 7 coins</li>
<li>and Custom Dice Block for 12 coins</li>
</ul>
<p>What you choose will depend on whether Bowser or Toadette is currently on Watermelon Island, as well as how many coins you have. Overall, I would say the best option, should you have enough coins, is the Custom Dice Block, and here's why.</p>
</div>
<div class="someimages">
<img src="images/yoshistropicalisland/10spacestostar.png" alt="10 spaces to the star">
<img src="images/yoshistropicalisland/Event Space before Bowser Yoshi's Tropical Island.png" alt="Event Space Before Bowser">
<p>If you stop on the second lucky space after the shop or later, you'll be within 10 spaces of Toadette or Bowser. You can then use your Custom Dice Block to guarantee a number high enough to reach the star before a player switches it. It's also worth noting that there's an event space <em>right</em> before that star area, so the Custom Dice Block can be used to bypass that. But this is the other draw to the Custom Dice Block. If Bowser is over there instead of Toadette, you can instead land on this Event Space, and now, you'll be in position to see Toadette on your next turn (as long as no one switches it before then), while getting another Event Space for the Eventful Bonus. In fact, that's the first Event Space in a long stretch - the previous one is right after the first Thwomp. This is why it's generally better to stay on Watermelon Island, even if Bowser is over there.</p>
<p>But let's say you can't afford to both buy the Custom Dice Block and the star. If Toadette is on Watermelon Island, you can either purchase a Mushroom or Double Dice to try to roll high enough to reach her before she switches with Bowser. If you're going to land on the Lucky Space after the Red Space or later, then the Mushroom is better, since it will guarantee you'll roll at least a 6, even if you get a 1 before the 5 is added. Otherwise, you'll always run the risk of landing on the Event Space and having to see Bowser the next turn. If Bowser is on Watermelon Island, then you can get a Cursed Dice Block and use it on yourself to either wait for someone to switch them or, if you can, try to land on the Event Space before the star. But this is quite luck dependent, since it requires you to land within 3 spaces of the Event Space, with the risk that you'll either undershoot or overshoot that one space. Finally, if a player is about to see Toadette on Cantaloupe Island, you can get a Warp Block and try warping to them. The great thing is that then <em>they'll</em> be on the way to seeing Bowser on their next turn.</p>

<div class="imagefloat">
<img src="images/yoshistropicalisland/Koopa Troopa Yoshi's Tropical Island.png" alt="Koopa" class="floatimage">
<p>Watermelon Island also has Koopa, who is six spaces after the area with the star. When you pass by Koopa, he'll always give you 10 coins.</p>

<p>The item shops on each board change during the last half of a game. For example, if you have a 20 turn game, the turn it'll change is the 11th turn. On this board, the five items from before are still available, but now, you have one more option: the Golden Pipe for 25 coins. By that point, you very well might have enough coins that you can afford to fork over the high cost for this item. If so, it is almost always worth it. You can proceed to the star area and then, once you have 20 coins, go back there with this item to get another one. But what's better is using this to go over to Cantaloupe Island, once the star is there. Not only do you not need to use the bottom Thwomp (which could have a large fee), but, again, Boo is just a few spaces ahead. If you have few stars but a lot of coins, this is your chance to make a comeback. Use your Golden Pipe to come over to Watermelon Island, and then, steal a star with Boo! Let's say you don't have enough coins to both buy the Star and then steal a star. No problem. You can choose to not buy the star. Just be careful, as you have to say no to Toadette three times. They really want you to get a star. If that's not enough, Watermelon Island has the board's sole Chance Time space. If you still have less stars than everyone else, then you can choose Star Swap first, and that way, you will benefit if you are on the selected characters. You can also do Star and Coin Swap if you have less coins than everyone else, too. The only downsides to going to Boo is that you have to roll past a Bowser and Red Space. Both of these can easily be enough to prevent you from being able to afford to steal a star.</p>
<p>Although you can definitely get items from the shop, don't forget to try to get some more from Lucky Spaces and Item Spaces. You can get items at the shop from these spaces as well, but you might also find the Triple Dice, Boo Bell, and Dueling Glove. As you can imagine, the Dueling Glove is a way to either prevent a player from using a Thwomp or to make them unable to steal a star from you. You just need to win the duel, or you can be in a worse spot.</p>
<p>And that should give you an idea of how to play Yoshi's Tropical Island. You can go to Cantaloupe Island to steal a star, and you can stick with Watermelon Island to stock up on items, since it has the board's item shop, one item space, and multiple Lucky Spaces. A good strategy is to start out at Watermelon Island to get a helpful item to get your first stars, and as the game goes on, go back to the shop to get a Golden Pipe to either get multiple stars or get a shortcut to Boo to steal a star. And you will see how impactful the Golden Pipe can be. Not only does it appear in the shop for everyone (including 1st place), there can be enough coins to go around to make the 25 coin price doable.</p>
