<p>This board has different rules for stars compared to Yoshi's Tropical Island. On this board, the star starts out on a blue space. Then, every time a star is purchased, it moves to another blue space on the board that a player is not currently standing on. The blue spaces that a star can spawn on are always the same. Check out the image in the bottom right corner to see the eight blue spaces designated to host a star.</p></div>

<p>If you view the board by selecting Board or pressing the Y button, you can also see where each star space, highlighted by a yellow circle. And, unique to this board, there are places for Toadette to stand on that also show where stars can spawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="boardoverview">
<p>One more thing is that, after doing some research, there appears to only be a handful of stars that can be the first star. If a star isn't circled, then you won't see it be the first star in a game.</p>

</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<img src="images/spaceland/itemspacesluckyspaces.png" width="1017" alt="Two Item Spaces and Two Lucky Spaces">
<p>There's 2 item spaces and 2 lucky spaces where you can get an item like a Double Dice or Mushroom to try to outrun the Event Spaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="imagefloat">
<img src="images/spaceland/firstjunction.png" alt="First Junction" width="400" class="floatimage">
<p>But once you do evade the event spaces, you now get to a junction where you need to decide to go up the diagonal or take the long path to the left. For the most part, I would say the main reason to go left is for the one star space on the path. That's because even if you take the diagonal, there's another path that'll put you back towards this part of the board. Looking at the first potential stars, there's only one where you need to go to the left.</p>
</div>
<div class="imagefloat">
<img src="images/spaceland/center.png" alt="Center of the board" class="floatimage"><p>Taking the diagonal path leads to the centerpiece of the board. Whenever a player crosses this junction, taking one of four paths, this countdown goes down by 1. It starts out at 5, and once it goes down to 0, the Bowser Coin Beam event will commence, where Black Hole Bowser sends out a laser across the diagonal. Anyone in its way will lose <em>all</em> of their coins.</p>

<p>The event still triggers if there are no players on the diagonal, too.</p>

<img src="images/spaceland/Diagonal.png" alt="Diagonal" width="550" class="floatimage">
<p>That is the risk of taking the diagonal path, so always keep in mind how low it is, and whether a player can set it to 0 while you're vulnerable. I'll show you a way to get to the center of the board without going to the diagonal in a moment. To do that, simply take the long path. If you do, you'll come across the board's one item shop.</p>

<p>Your options are:
<ul>
<li>Skeleton Key for 3 coins</li>
<li>Cursed Dice Block for 3 coins</li>
<li>Double Dice for 5 coins</li>
<li>Warp Block for 7 coins</li>
<li>Triple Dice for 10 coins</li>
<li>and Custom Dice Block for 12 coins</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imagefloat"><br>
<p>Because this board has a decent amount of Item Spaces and Lucky Spaces, you might be able to get some items outside of this shop. From these spaces, you might get a Skeleton Key, and that's good. But if you don't, you might consider getting one here. Not only is it 3 coins, but just a little later is the board's first Skeleton Gate, and it's pretty good.</p>
<img src="images/spaceland/Skeleton Gate 1.png" alt="First Skeleton Gate" class="floatimage"><p>For one, this is one of the ways to reach the center of the board, which, besides housing many star spaces, allows access to a lot of areas on the board. But what's just as important is that it contains a Boo. Not only do you get a good position, but you can steal some coins or even a star in the process.</p>

  <source src="videos/spaceland/SecondRunawayScapeship.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>If you don't go through this gate, then you're at the top straightaway, which is in a similar position to the initial area. This time, there are three event spaces, and landing on any of them will take you all the way back to the blue space before the long path. If you need to get across this section, then consider getting a Triple Dice Block from the shop to try to get past it in one turn. If that's not important, and you already have a Skeleton Key, then the Custom Dice Block is good to have, especially since it eventually becomes unavailable from the shop. This ends up on the diagonal, which you can either go down for a star space or to go to the center that gives you four options, or you can take it up, and that can be good, too. Just note that there are two spaces you have to get across before you're not in the path of the Bowser Coin Beam.</p>
</div>
<div class="imagefloat">
<img src="images/spaceland/Boo.png" alt="Second Boo" class="floatimage">
<p>Going to the right notably gives access to Boo - yes, this board has two Boos. So, you can still visit Boo without having to take the Skeleton Gate route. From there, this section returns to the starting area. However, there is a junction that will, again, go towards the center of the board. Because there are so many ways to reach the center of the board, and because you have four options from the countdown, this might be the board with the most flexibility in your position.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="clear:both;width:60%;">
<img src="images/spaceland/Center2.png" alt="Main Area" class="imageblock">
<p>Your four options from the center are to go left, right, up, and down. Going left is how to get to one of the star spaces, and it takes you to the board's item shop, where you can get a Skeleton Key to return to the center. Going up takes you to the straightaway, putting you in a position for a star space. Going down puts you at the starting section. From there, you can get to one of the star spaces if you land on the Event Space after the Koopa Bank. Speaking of, you might be able to land on the Koopa Bank and get a healthy sum of coins. But going right is notable, since it goes to the diagonal and allows you to return to the center again. If you have a high roll, this can give you a new space to land on. For example, if you have a 9 remaining, you can loop this section and go up to land on an Item Space. Another reason is that you can stall over here and maybe be in position for two star spaces. The third is that this is how to access the board's second Skeleton Gate. There's two reasons to take this gate. For one, it's a shortcut to the star on the bottom right - a better way than going down and having to land on the Event Space. But it also houses the board's only <img class="smallspace" src="images/spaces/Chance Time.png" alt="Chance Time Space" /> Chance Time Spaces. It's a good combination to have both a Skeleton Key and a Custom Dice Block. That way, you can use the Custom Dice Block to land on one of the Chance Time Spaces if you need to do that to make a comeback. Because there's two in a row, having a Cursed Dice Block and using it on yourself can also work, as long as you can be within 3 spaces of these two spaces. But later on, you'll see that if you have a lot of coins, there's other ways to turn things around. The final reason to take the right path is to lower the center more frequently. If you need to lower it as much as possible, then you can use a Double Dice or Triple Dice to loop this section and bring this section down to 0. This is great if some player is on the diagonal. Losing all your coins is brutal. But you have to remember that you have to take the diagonal to do so, so make sure you don't end up being in trouble of losing all of your coins by stopping on the diagonal, in position for another player to bring it down to 0 before your next turn. Even then, you can take the Skeleton Gate to get out of the diagonal's path.</p>

<img src="images/spaceland/Farm Boo Space Land.png" class="floatimage" alt="Visit Boo Multiple Times" height="600">
<p>And now, it's time to show you that, if you are rich, you can really break this board. To start, let's introduce an event called the Snifit Patrol. You'll notice that right after the blue spaces the Runaway Spaceship sends you to has a Snifit, which means you can visit them after being caught in the Runaway Spaceship event. If you pay 5 coins to him, the next time a player lands on the Event Space in the corresponding straightaway, it starts out as normal - but once you get to the Snifit, he drags you along further. For the bottom right Snifit, you'll end up on the top right blue space. For the top left Snifit, you'll end up on the bottom left blue space. For the former, look at where that puts you. Not only does that put you in a position to get this star, which can be difficult to get normally, but right after the star is Boo. It gets better. There's an event space right after the Snifit, so if you land there, you can pay the Snifit and be on your way to Boo on your next turn. You can intentionally land on this Event Space with a Custom Dice Block, too. This allows you to double dip on Boo. You can use one visit to steal coins, and another to steal a star. But if you have plenty of coins, you can steal two stars! Just remember that if there are any players on the bottom straight path, they'll come along with you.</p>
</div>
<div class="imagefloat" style="width:90%;padding:10px;">
<img src="images/spaceland/Farm Item Shop Space Land.png" class="floatimage" alt="Visit Item Shop Multiple Times" height="600">
What about the other Snifit Patrol? Going all the way down is a way to get access to a star space again, but this time, the draw is that you'll also encounter the board's item shop. This allows you to visit the shop twice, meaning you can use one visit to get a Skeleton Key to take the alternate path with Boo.</p>
</div>
<div class="floatvideo">
<video width="540" height="360" class="floatvideo" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="videos/spaceland/SecondItemShopSpace.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>However, consider what items the shop sells starting on the second half of the game. As mentioned, the Custom Dice Block no longer becomes an option. The Cursed Dice Block also becomes unavailable. The two new options are:
<ul>
<li>Chomp Call for 7 coins</li>
<li>Golden Pipe for 25 coins</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Normally, the Chomp Call can be oppressive, but it's made pretty irrelevant because of the Golden Pipe, since a player could just use that to go to the star. Really, if you have enough coins, there's no reason to choose the Chomp Call over the Golden Pipe. And maybe now you can see the implication of being able to visit the item shop two times. You can now buy <em>two</em> Golden Pipes and use that to get two stars. If that wasn't enough, I should now mention that there are <em>four</em> star spaces not far from the item shop. Take note of the four circled in red:</p><br><br>
<img src="images/spaceland/starspacestoitemshop.png" alt="Four Stars Near Item Shop" width="800">
</div>
<div class="imagefloat">
<p>What this means is that you can use a Golden Pipe to get one of these stars, and then just a little later, go to the item shop to get <em>another</em> Golden Pipe. How effective this strategy is isn't just based on if you have enough coins to pull this off, but also how many turns there are. This is not really doable in 10 or 15 turn games, since the item shop won't have Golden Pipes long enough to do this. But for 20 turns or longer, it can be done. So, if you have a lot of coins but are struggling to get stars, not to worry. You have two great options. You can easily visit Boo or farm Golden Pipes. It's made just that easier thanks to the Snifit Patrol. But, obviously, there is going to be a big risk to pull this off, and that's because the spaces the Snifit Patrol land on happen to be on the diagonal. Thus, you'll be vulnerable to losing all your coins if the Bowser Coin Beam activates before your next turn. However, if you see a player trying to pull this off, now you have a measure to halt their plans. If you're too far away from the center or the Bowser Coin Beam can't be lowered soon enough, then you can always consider the Warp Block, or, better yet, the Super Warp Block to cut them off from the item shop or Boo.</p>
<p>And that concludes Space Land. The board's design allows you good control of your position on the board, meaning you should be able to navigate around to each star space. But this board becomes a different story if it goes on long enough, since Golden Pipes are a thing, and they can be farmed, as well as how Boo can be seen more often than on normal boards. If you have a lot of coins, you can rely on Golden Pipes and Boo to turn things around, without needing a Chance Time space to do your dirty work. Besides, because there's only two Chance Time spaces and they're locked behind a Skeleton Gate, you might not even have to worry about Chance Time.</p>
