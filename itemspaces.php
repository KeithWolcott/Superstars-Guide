<p>When you land on a Red Space, you get to participate in an Item Minigame where you have a chance to receive a free item. There's five possible "minigames" that can show up, and it is possible to not receive an item from all 5 of them. There's only two of these where it's pretty reliable to get whichever item you want. For the other three, it's nearly unpredictable.</p>

<p>The first is <strong>Roll Out the Barrels</strong> from Mario Party 2. The losing condition is if you pick the barrel with Bowser Jr. This is the easiest one. As long as you can concentrate on the barrel with the item you want, you should be able to get it. There is some chance, though, as some shuffle more than others.</p>
