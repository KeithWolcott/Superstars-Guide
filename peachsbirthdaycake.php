<p>Like Yoshi's Tropical Island, the star starts at the same place every time, and Bowser is on the board as well. However, the two do not switch ever.</p>
<p>On the way to this one star, you'll come across four pairs of <img class="smallspace" src="images/spaces/Event Space.png" alt="Event Space" /> Event Spaces. Landing on them at first summons Lakitu, who gives you two options. You can either set a coin-stealing Strawberry for 5 coins, or a star-stealing Strawberry for 30 coins. This is a difference from the original, who only had the latter option.</p>

<p>When another player lands on one of the two <img class="smallspace" src="images/spaces/Event Space.png" alt="Event Space" /> Event Spaces correlating to the Strawberry you set, they'll either have to give you between 5 to 10 coins for a small Strawberry, or a star for a big one. Afterwards, it goes away, but if it's small, there's a chance it will remain for one more steal. If the opponent doesn't have coins or a star to steal, nothing happens.</p>

<p>If you land on one of your Piranha Plant's, he'll give you the 5 to 10 coins, no matter if it's small or large. However, if it's small, and you have enough coins, Lakitu comes back to give you the option to convert your Strawberry to a large one for 30 coins.</p>

<p>These Event Spaces take the place of Boo, who does not appear on this board. You should always set one of these traps if you have enough coins, since you will at least break even with the coin one, or you can really change up the standings by stealing a star from another player!</p>
<p>The Event Spaces being in pairs has some implications. Not only does it make them harder to avoid, it means you have the chance to activate the same one two turns in a row. You just need to stop on one and roll a 1 the next turn. If a player lands on it before your next turn, this gives you the chance to plant another one right away.</p>

<p>A little after the board's one star is the board's one item shop. It sells the following, just like Yoshi's Tropical Island:
<ul>
<li>Mushroom for 3 coins</li>
<li>Cursed Dice Block for 3 coins</li>
<li>Double Dice for 5 coins</li>
<li>Warp Block for 7 coins</li>
<li>and Custom Dice Block for 12 coins</li>
</ul>
<p>This time, the item you choose will be based on whether you got a star or how many coins you have. If you have enough coins, you'll probably want to get back to the star as soon as possible. Thus, get a Mushroom or Double Dice. Those options can also be used to roll past a Star Stealing Piranha Plant later on in the board. If you don't have much coins, then the Warp Block can be powerful. You can use it to get out of a bad spot, but it's particularly brutal if everyone is closer to the star. Then, not only will you get a big shortcut to the star, you're impeding the progress of another player. If you didn't get a star, then get the Custom Dice Block if you can afford it. Why? Chance Time. Now, if you choose Swap Stars first, you won't have to worry about losing anything. The Event Spaces being in pairs also makes the Cursed Dice Block potent, as it can dramatically increase the chance of a player landing on one of your Piranha Plants if they are within 3 spaces, but still, I wouldn't recommend buying it.</p>

<p>And now we get to the Flower Lottery, which happens four spaces after the Item Shop. A Goomba will ask ten coins to participate in this event.</p>

<p>If you have less than that, you'll just have to pay all the coins you have.</p>

<p>You're presented four seeds. Three of them result in a normal flower that takes you on this path.</p>

<div class="videofloat">
<p>However, in the mix is a Bowser seed that takes you on the path with Bowser. The seeds reset once a player finds the Bowser seeds. That means if the three safe ones are found first, the next one is guaranteed to be Bowser.</p>

<p>When you meet up with Bowser, it's the same story as Yoshi's Tropical Island. Either you'll get a Cursed Dice Block or a Bowser Cake. The Cursed Dice Block usually costs between 13 to 20 coins, but the Bowser Cake always costs 20 coins.</p>

<p>And again, if you visit him in last place, there's a very small chance that he'll give you 5 coins, but again, it's rare, so usually, the previous options will occur.</p>
<p>Anyway, the fact that Bowser can give you the Cursed Dice Block is one reason why I can't recommend buying the Cursed Dice Block from the shop. The other is the fact that, well, this board has <em>NO</em> <img class="smallspace" src="images/spaces/Item Space.png" alt="Item Space" /> Item Spaces! The only other source of items are from <img class="smallspace" src="images/spaces/Lucky Space.png" alt="Lucky Space" /> Lucky Spaces, but those can just as easily give you coins, so you'll want to make the item you choose from the shop worth it.</p>

<div class="videofloat">
<p>Making matters worse is this Slide that happens just two spaces before the Item Shop. If you land on it, you'll go down to the blue space below. While this does give you an Extra <img class="smallspace" src="images/spaces/Event Space.png" alt="Event Space" />Event Space for the Eventful Bonus, this means you lose access to the Item Shop. However, it also means you avoid the Flower Lottery, so you don't have to worry about losing a lot of coins to Bowser, which sounds like a decent tradeoff, right? Well, no. And here's why.</p>
<p>In the original, going to the route with Bowser just looped you back to the Flower Lottery. However, in this board, the Bowser path doesn't go back to the Flower Lottery, but instead goes...back to the star, skipping past all those Piranha Plants! So, I would say it's actually to your advantage to get the Bowser seed, which is the opposite of the original. Even though you will be losing a lot of coins to Bowser, there's some spaces on the way that can make it worth it. There's some Lucky Spaces, where you might get enough coins to afford the star. Or there's a VS Space. If it's for enough coins and you win, there's some more coins. Right after the VS space is Chance Time, so if every player has more coins than you, just select Coin Swap and try to get yourself in it. Finally, there's a Bowser space, and while it's not a good strategy, there is the possibility of getting a Bowser Revolution. Those last three are right by each other, so if you got a Cursed Dice Block from Bowser, you can maybe use it on yourself to land on one of these spaces. But it's better to get a Custom Dice Block from the shop beforehand to guarantee you land on the best space.</p>
</div>
<div class="someimages">
<img src="images/peachsbirthdaycake/Plants at Bottom Right Peach's Birthday Cake.png" alt="Plant after Flower Lottery">
<img src="images/peachsbirthdaycake/Koopa Troopa Peach's Birthday Cake.png" alt="Koopa">
<p>If you end up going to a normal path, there is one more flower you can take advantage of. Then, the start is not far off, where Koopa will give you 10 coins. But notice how there is a Chance Time space on the way. That means that no matter if you get Bowser or not, there will be a Chance Time space available, so if everyone but you got a star, you can get a Custom Dice Block, figure out which path you will take, and use the Custom Dice Block to land on Chance Time and aim for a Star Swap with you. And if you have less coins than everyone else, you might as well go for Star and Coin Swap.</p>

  <source src="videos/peachsbirthdaycake/SecondItemShopPeach.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Now onto the shop in the second half of the game. Like Yoshi's Tropical Island, every item from before is still available, but this time, the new item is the Triple Dice instead of the Golden Pipe. Imagine how broken the Golden Pipe would be on this board, so it makes sense. The Triple Dice is a great choice if you have at least 50 coins and the only seed left is Bowser. Then, you can visit Bowser, only losing up to 20 coins, and buy the star afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="videofloat">
<p>And that's it for Peach's Birthday Cake. It stands out by not having as many items due to no Item Spaces, including having no Golden Pipes, as well as how there's no junctions outside the Flower Lottery. With the star staying in one space the entire time, it does become more important to reach it with enough coins, but if you don't, then you can hope for a player to land on a Piranha Plant that'll steal a star and give it to you, made harder by a lack of items. Otherwise, there's always Chance Time.</p>
