<p>When you land on a Chance Time Space, you activate the Chance Time event, where players can exchange coins and stars. As you can imagine, Chance Time has the possibility of completing changing the outcome of the game, and this is the reason why you can turn things around if you get unlucky. What makes this event stand out is how you actually have some control of the outcome. You get the decide the order of the three blocks, two of which determine the players involved and the middle being the items being traded. Each time you hit a dice block, the other ones spin faster, meaning the only one where you really get to choose is the first one.</p>

<p>At the start, the two characters are whoever landed on the Chance Time space, and the middle one is the player on the left gives three coins.</p>

<p>The middle dice block always revolves in this order, no matter what turn it is:</p>

<p>For the other two dice blocks, the order of the players is based on the turn order. For example, if the turn order is Rosalina, Yoshi, Waluigi, and Donkey Kong, and Waluigi landed on the Chance Time space, the dice blocks will cycle through Waluigi, Donkey Kong, Rosalina, Yoshi.</p>

<p>Once a character is selected on dice block, they are removed from the other dice block so they won't trade with themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="videofloat">
<p>Overall, the one you'll have the most control over is the first one, and for that one, rather than memorizing the order of everything, you can just hit the dice block when the one right before the one you want shows up. For example, if you want a Star, you can jump when the trade is on 20 coins to the right to get Star to the right. Or if you want to be involved, you can hit yourself on one of the dice blocks. If you do either of these, though, you always run the risk of losing coins or a star. For the former, let's say you go on to accidentally choose yourself on the left dice block. Then you're giving up a star to the player on the right. Alternately, if you put yourself on a dice block first, then there's the risk of you selecting the option of you giving a star to the other player when you get to the middle dice block. Because of that, there's only a few ways I see Chance Time being effective.</p>
<p>For one, if you have the least amount of coins, then you will benefit from a Coin Swap if that is selected. Even if you do not end up being involved, you lose nothing. If you have the least amount of stars, the same logic: at best you gain stars, and at worst you lose nothing. And if you have the least amount of coins and stars, then go for Coin and Star Swap! But if you don't have the least amount of either, then you have a choice. Do you want to risk losing 30 coins or a star, or would it better to play it safe? As you can tell, there is a boring option to just give away 3 coins, so if do not want to lose big, then it might be better to be safe and not sorry and choose that. Because the trade matters so much, I recommend going for the middle dice block first and then hoping for the best with the character dice blocks, since the probability of getting the character you want is higher than the probability of getting the trade you want. That's just me, though. But since there are ways to sort of get what you want with this iteration of Chance Time, this becomes a great space to go for, particularly if you are behind. Again, it might be your only hope of winning some games.</p>
